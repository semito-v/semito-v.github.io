# SemiTO-V Website

Website of SemiTO-V Team PoliTO, based on customized just-the-docs template

# just-the-docs-template

This is a *bare-minimum* template to create a [Jekyll] site that:

- uses the [Just the Docs] theme;
- can be built and published on [GitHub Pages];
- can be built and previewed locally, and published on other platforms.

More specifically, the created site:

- uses a gem-based approach, i.e. uses a `Gemfile` and loads the `just-the-docs` gem;
- uses the [GitHub Pages / Actions workflow] to build and publish the site on GitHub Pages.
