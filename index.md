Welcome to our website! *SemiTO-V* is a student team at [Polytechnic University of Turin](https://www.polito.it/en) that uses open standard [RISC-V ISA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RISC-V) based cores to create custom processors, firmware, and software as well as our own PCB designs. Weâ€™re mastering everything from circuit analysis to processor architecture, and from RTL design to low-level software development for RISC-V platforms (RV32 and potentially RV64).

Our mission is to use, leverage and enhance standardized/popular open RISC-V cores, making our own processor designs (MCU, PPU etc), designing our own PCBs with FPGA and other components to run them, optimizing them for real-world applications (IMU, AI accelerator etc) while improving their software/firmware ecosystem and benchmarking them against other chips.

We as a team believe that biggest problem of existing RISC-V hardware is lack of good firmware and software compatibility. For that reason, we want to focus on maximizing performance, power efficiency, and software support for existing RISC-V chips, ensuring they are fully utilized across embedded systems, cloud, edge computing, HPC and beyond.
