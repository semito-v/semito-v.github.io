# Our Vision
SemiTO-V envisions a future where computing is truly democratizedâ€”a future in which both software and hardware are fully open, free from black boxes, proprietary restrictions, and vendor lock-in. This future is made possible by RISC-V, the open standard ISA (Instruction Set Architecture), which, thanks to huge industry support, unlocks unprecedented innovation, collaboration, and accessibility in computing. As students, we aim to participate in this computing revolution. In line with this vision, we want to build our careers in RISC-V-related fields and contribute to RISC-V as undergraduates and graduates alike. To achieve this, we believe the best way to start is to form a student team dedicated to RISC-V ISA and technologies around it.

# Our Approach
## Hardware and Logic Dev:
- Use cores based on RISC-V ISA (RV32/RV64), add custom instructions and modules
- Implement SoCs targeting FPGAs
- Interface with peripherals, make our processors wifi-enabled.
- Design open source FPGA and ASIC chip based PCBs
- Explore advanced features such as pipelining and parallel processing (potentially for HPC)

## Software and Instruction Dev
- Develop/improve bare-metal firmware, RTOS (FreeRTOS) and time-sharing OS (Linux for RV64) implementations
- Port and optimize compilers for our processors
- Contribute to the software that are important for RISC-V ecosystem (Linux kernel, LLVM, vector libraries)
- Create our own SDKs, toolchains and simulators for our designs
- Develop benchmarks/configure existing ones to run tests on our designs and existing ones, comparing performance of RISC-V technologies
